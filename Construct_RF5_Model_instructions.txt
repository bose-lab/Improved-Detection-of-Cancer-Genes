INSTRUCTIONS TO USE Construct_RF5_Model.r 

1) Install the most recent version of R on your operating system of choice. The R installer is quite good about
	setting environmental paths so that you can access the required utilities from commandline. 
	
2) Install the randomForest package for R. This can be accomplished easily from within the R interactive interface
	with the following command: >install.packages("randomForest")
	
3) Test that the Rscript utility is accessable. Typing "Rscript" into commandline should result in usage instructions. 
	If it does not, check the R installation guidelines for your operating system.

4) Format your input file. Ensure it is tab delimited and that the column headers match those found in
	example_cosmic_data.txt. The "Label" column is the only optional column. If it is absent or incorrect, the script will 
	use the default HiConf cancer gene panel to generate a label vector. 
	
5) If you would like to see the predictions that the published pan-cancer RF5 model would make on new data, ensure
	that final_pan-cancer_RF5_model.Rdata is present in the working directory. 
	
6) Run the script with: $Rscript Construct_RF5_Model.r <input_file>

7) The genes, five test results, random forest Out-of-Bag vote proportions and label vector will be written to <input_file>.rf5.output.txt

NOTE to users: The script will train a new RF5 model for the provided data (custom model), and it will also apply the 
model from the manuscript directly if it is available (published model). Predictions for the published model are provided for comparison
only. In general, the custom model that is retrained on new data will be more accurate and relevant.
